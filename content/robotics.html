  <h2>Journey of Robotic Discovery: Igniting Passion and Curiosity</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
  In the quiet corners of my childhood imagination, where dreams took flight like stars in the night sky, my parents weaved a tale of adventure that began with an extraordinary decision - enrolling me in Lego Mindstorms ev3 lessons. Little did I know that this seemingly innocent choice would become the portal to an exhilarating journey, carrying me across uncharted lands of creativity and innovation. As I set foot on this untrodden path, I was beckoned into a world where the alchemy of robotics fused engineering and technology with the touch of a child's wonder. With each turn of gears and every line of code, I found myself spellbound by the marvels I could create, soaring through the realms of boundless imagination at a tender age. Through this enchanting early exposure, a spark of fascination and curiosity ignited within me, illuminating the way to a future where the cosmos of possibilities shimmered with infinite promise.

    <h2>VexU - PYRO's revival: <i>Air Blast</i></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    In 2022, my journey with VexU began as I gained acceptance into Arizona State University (ASU). While
    reminiscing about the past, I discovered that the once illustrious team, PYRO, had faced setbacks during
    the tumultuous times of the COVID-19 pandemic. With a deep-rooted desire to reignite the team's former
    glory and achieve the coveted title of Vex world champion, I eagerly joined their ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
    The season of "Spin Up" in 2022-2023 became an opportunity for me to breathe life back into PYRO and
    make our mark on the Vex landscape once again. Through relentless dedication and innovation, I
    meticulously crafted a one-of-a-kind robot known as the Air Blast. This creation garnered unwavering
    admiration from the judges at the tournament, leaving them in awe of its ingenuity. In fact, the
    esteemed head of the game development committee even declared it his "favorite robot of all time."
    </p>
    <p>
    The ripple effect of Air Blast's success spread far and wide, resonating with teams across the globe.
    The resoundingly positive feedback received from these teams, including high school students who shared
    a passion for Vex, was truly inspiring. Remarkably, the impact was so profound that some aspiring
    individuals expressed their desire to join ASU solely based on the extraordinary robot I had designed
    and built.
    </p>
    <p>
    To further validate the greatness of Air Blast, it proudly clinched the prestigious Build Award, the
    highest honor bestowed upon a meticulously crafted robot, at the world championship event. This accolade
    served as a testament to the vision and craftsmanship that breathed life into Air Blast, solidifying its
    place in Vex history.
    </p>
    <p>
    With one purpose accomplished and the team's resurgence well underway, I am more determined than ever to
    strive toward the ultimate goal of claiming the title of Vex world champion. This remarkable journey has
    not only reaffirmed my commitment to PYRO but also ignited a passion within others, leaving an indelible
    impact on the Vex community as a whole.

    <h2>Vex VRC - Ignite: Pioneering the Path of Robotics Excellence</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Vex robotics has been an integral part of my life since my sophomore year of high school, marking a
    serendipitous encounter during my transition from Fuhsing Private School (FHJH) to Kang Chiao
    International School (KCIS). FHJH served as the gateway that initially introduced me to the captivating
    realm of competitive robotics.
    </p>
    <p>
    My journey began with two immersive years in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) during my middle
    school days, although I must admit that the intricacies of FRC posed a significant challenge at the
    time. Nonetheless, it was through my involvement in FRC that I first discovered the closely intertwined
    world of Vex robotics. However, to my chagrin, I soon realized that KCIS exclusively offered Vex to
    junior and senior students.
    </p>
    <p>
    Determined not to let timing hinder my passion, I embarked on a mission to establish a robotics program
    at KCIS, designed specifically for freshmen. Recognizing that it would be a missed opportunity to wait
    until my last two years of high school, I endeavored to create a pathway for students to delve into the
    wonders of robotics right from the outset of their freshman year.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, embarking on a new program holds little meaning unless accompanied by compelling results. In a
    remarkable display of skill and determination, our nascent team triumphed at our inaugural competition,
    seizing the coveted Amaze Award—an accolade bestowed upon teams that exhibit extraordinary performance,
    versatility, and overall excellence. This momentous achievement marked a historic milestone for KCIS, as
    no team had ever secured any recognition before.
    </p>
    <p>
    The momentum of our success continued to surge throughout the season, propelling us to claim the title
    of national champions. This resounding victory also earned KCIS its first-ever qualification for the
    World Championship, solidifying our team's position as trailblazers within our school's proud history.
    To this day, our record remains unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
    By etching our names into the illustrious history of KCIS, our accomplishments not only left an
    indelible mark but also ignited a spark of inspiration within future generations of robotics
    enthusiasts, compelling them to strive for greatness. Embracing the responsibility to foster the ongoing
    success of our school, I took the initiative to establish a Discord server—an interactive platform
    designed to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among incoming students with a passion for
    robotics. This virtual space serves as a haven where inquisitive minds can seek guidance, pose
    questions, and engage in meaningful discussions with experienced competitors from previous years.
    </p>
    <p>
    The impact of this Discord server has surpassed all expectations, paving the way for the emergence of a
    new wave of accomplished KCIS Robotics participants. As these aspiring individuals leverage the
    collective wisdom and experience available to them, they embark on their own remarkable journeys,
    achieving commendable success and upholding the proud legacy of our school's robotics program.
